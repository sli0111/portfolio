# Data Science Portfolio by Simon Li

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks in which I explore and analyze data science science problems with machine learning.  The projects below are divided into several main categories: tutorials, kaggle competitions, regression problems, natural language processing, neural networks, and data exploration.

## Tutorials


## Kaggle Competitions


## Regression problems


## Clustering

### An Introduction to Digit Classification with KNN

[Github](https://sli0111.github.io/MNIST_KNN/)

Handwritten digits are used on bank checks, medical applications, and mail but vary in depending on the individual.  In this project, a the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits images are classified a number between 0 to 9 using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm.


## Natural Language Processing

### Random Acts of Pizza (ROAP)

[Github](https://github.com/sli0111/raop) [nbviewr](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sli0111/raop/blob/main/Baseline_and_Logistic_Regression_Model_v4.ipynb)

A popular subreddit is random acts of pizza, where strangers can request for free pizza from other strangers.  People's request are in the form of text data thus natural language processing was applied using the nltk package and unsupervised text clustering with KMeans algorithm to extract features.  Extracted features were used with a logistic regression model algorithm to predict which post would receive pizza.

## Neural Networks


# Data Exploration

### Lyft Bikeshare

[Github](https://github.com/sli0111/lyft_bikeshare) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sli0111/lyft_bikeshare/blob/gh-pages/Lyft%20Bikeshare.ipynb#)

The bikeshare industry is still growing especially in modern cities.  This project utilizes the Lyft Bikeshare dataset on the Google Gloud Platform and applies BigQuery, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Seaborn to explore opportunities to increase membership,
