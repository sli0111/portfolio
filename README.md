# Data Science Portfolio by Simon Li

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks in which I explore and analyze data science science problems with machine learning.  The projects below are divided into several main categories: tutorials, kaggle competitions, regression problems, natural language processing, neural networks, and data exploration.

## Tutorials


## Kaggle Competitions


## Regression problems


## Clustering

### An Introduction to Digit Classification with KNN

[Github](https://sli0111.github.io/MNIST_KNN/)

Handwritten digits are used on bank checks, medical applications, and mail but vary in depending on the individual.  In this project, a the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits images are classified a number between 0 to 9 using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm.


## Natural Language Processing


## Neural Networks


# Data Exploration

### Lyft Bikeshare

[Github](https://github.com/sli0111/lyft_bikeshare) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sli0111/lyft_bikeshare/blob/gh-pages/Lyft%20Bikeshare.ipynb#)

The bikeshare industry is still growing especially in modern cities.  This project utilizes the Lyft Bikeshare dataset on the Google Gloud Platform and applies BigQuery, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Seaborn to explore opportunities to increase membership,
